# e4040-2022Fall-project-xswl

## Basic Information:
- Project name (paper name): MobileNet: Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks for Mobile Vision Applications
- Group Menber: Yingqi Ma ym2926, Zhan Shu zs2584, Zihao Xiao zx2407


## Location of Dataset:
  - The dataset We used is cifar100 from keras.
  - Website link: https://keras.io/api/datasets/cifar100/.
  
## How to run the code:
 - Since the data we use can be downloaded directly from the web, we wrote the code in jupyter notebook to load that dataset.
 - You can directly download two files called E4040_project_fianlmodel.ipynb and mobilenet.py. Put them in a folder and upload it to your environment. Then you just need to open the E4040_project_fianlmodel.ipynb and run the code inside it.
 - Opening the file called E4040_project_fianlmodel.ipynb


## The name of the main jupyter notebook:
- E4040_project_fianlmodel.ipynb

## Key functions of each file in the project:
- E4040_project_fianlmodel.ipynb: Our main jupyter notebook, contains all the processes of our project. It concludes Data loading, Data pre-processing, MobileNet building, Model training, Parameter tuning and Image drawing.
- mobilenet.py: This file contains the code of MobileNet architecture.
- E4040.2022Fall.XSWL.report.ym2926.zs2584.zx2407.pdf: Our subject report.
